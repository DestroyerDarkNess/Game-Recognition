# Game-Recognition
Using Recognition Systems / AI for Game Hacking.

This Idea came from nowhere, Well Imagine an AI or some recognition system that detects enemies in video games, you could do all kinds of things, Aimbot, Trigger Bot, No Recoil, Enemig Target Box. etc...

Basically it works as the facial recognition of your phones.

Advantage :

Universal to all types of Games, Free !!!!!!! Free Cheats !!!!

Disadvantages:

- Slow (Currently). I don't have any help. It's just me trying to create something great and absurd. xddd
